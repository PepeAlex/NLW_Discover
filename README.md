# NLW_Discover

This is an interactive application through questions that the user can create your own room to answer anonymous questions than they can be managed through password.

This project was developed in the NLW-6 week from Rocketseat. The project idea can be finding https://github.com/rocketseat-education/nlw-06-discover

The technologies used are:

  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - NodeJs
  - EJS
  - Express
  - SQLite

I would like to thank the entire Rocketseat team for supporting this learning process. It is very important for beginners to have the developer time with projector to create and deadline to do it as we will find when we are working.
